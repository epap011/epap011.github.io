Hi! I’m Efthimis Papageorgiou, but you can call me Makis. I was born in Athens and am currently a master’s student in computer science at the University of Crete. Alongside my studies, I work as a graduate research assistant at the Information Systems Lab at the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)  

Outside of my work, I’m a big fan of cosmic horror (yes, Lovecraft is one of my favorites) and dystopian themes, love playing the bass, and enjoy a good discussion. I’m also always up for a hiking adventure whenever I get the chance!
